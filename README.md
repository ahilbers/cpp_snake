# cpp_snake
A simple terminal snake game, written in `c++`.

### Creating the game

To create the game, run 

```
sh compile.sh
```

This should work from a terminal on Mac. For Windows, and Linux,
you'll have to change the compiler in `compile.sh`, e.g. to `g++`
(and probably also change the flags).


### Playing the game

To play the game, create the game via the above instructions and then call

```
./play_snake
```

from a commmand line.
